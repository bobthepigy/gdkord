# Original Themes
Ok, so I started by mashing [this theme](https://github.com/phenom4n4n/blurple-replacer) and [this theme](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord) and [this theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z7zEc7AXQ) together and then adding my own stuff on top :/

Original theme creators: [Phenom4n4n](https://github.com/phenom4n4n), [LuckFire](https://github.com/LuckFire)

## Other stuff
Due to the naturally natural nature of this theme being such a hottie, it's no surprise that it's basically a big dumpster fire that needs to be put out dozens of times daily.
This is to say that I commit so fricking much that if you were to run `git pull` every hour, you'd pretty much end up with an entirely different theme by the end of the day

lol
